echo - The echo command in Linux is a built-in shell utility used to display a line of text or strings that are passed as arguments to the standard output (usually your terminal screen).
Echo Escape Sequences( ES )- always for es use -e syntax : echo -e "text es" 
Escape Sequences - there are 7+.
1.) \n - new line echo -e "hi\nbuddy"
2.) \t - Tab 4 space better for columns and rows "A\tb"
3.) \b - Backspace based on terminal echo -e "Heloo\b"
4.) \r - Return to start echo -e "wait...\rDone" if i want exact last valuse use some space after last word
5.) \\ - Backslash echo -e "c:\\user"
6.) \' - single quote echo -e 'It\'s ok'
7.) \" - Double quote echo -e "He said \"Hi\""
8.) \c - Stop Output echo -e "Stop\c"

Printf - It's the same as echo, but echo is used for smaller or single-line code. printf is more consistent, produces correct comment code, and is preferred.
Perfect spacing.Perfect alignment.Works the same everywhere.Best for shell scripts.Does NOT add extra spaces or newlines unless you tell it.
